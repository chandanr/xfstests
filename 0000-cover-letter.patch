Subject: [PATCH V4 00/11] xfs: Tests to verify inode fork extent count overflow detection
To: fstests@vger.kernel.org
Cc: linux-xfs@vger.kernel.org,
    darrick.wong@oracle.com,
    djwong@kernel.org

The patchset at
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-xfs/20210110160720.3922965-1-chandanrlinux@gmail.com/T/
added support for XFS to detect inode extent count overflow when
performing various filesystem operations. The patchset also added
new error injection tags for,
1. Reducing maximum extent count to 10.
2. Allocating only single block sized extents.

The corresponding code for xfsprogs can be obtained from
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-xfs/20201104114900.172147-1-chandanrlinux@gmail.com/.

The patches posted along with this cover letter add tests to verify
the correctness of in-kernel inode extent count overflow detection
mechanism.

These patches can also be obtained from
https://github.com/chandanr/xfstests.git at branch
extent-overflow-tests.

Changelog:
V3 -> V4:
  1. Rebase on fstests' latest master branch.

V2 -> V3:
  1. Kernel's max pseudo extent count is once again set to 10. Hence
     change the tests back to using 10 as the maximum extent count.
  2. The following tests associated with directories have been removed
     since directory remove and rename operations are not expected to
     fail (with -EFBIG error code) in low inode extent count
     scenarios:
     - Populate source directory and mv one entry to destination
       directory.
     - Populate a directory and remove one entry.

V1 -> V2:
  1. Obtain extent count for inodes accessible through filesystem path
     names via "xfs_io -c 'stat' ..." command line. This gets rid of
     unmount/mount cycles from most of the tests.
  2. Use _fill_fs() to consume free space of a filesystem.
  3. Use _scratch_inject_error() helper to enable/disable error tags.
  4. Use sizeof(struct xfs_dqblk) to calculate number of quotas inside
     one filesystem block.
  5. Write once to every block of the quota inode instead of
     sequentially filling up each block.
  6. Use _get_file_block_size() for tests involving regular files.
  7. Modify tests to suit the new pseudo max extent count of 35.
  8. Replace xfs_io with $XFS_IO_PROG.
  9. Remove code that extended a realtime file since this takes the
     same path as direct I/O to a regular file.
  10. For xattr, do not execute test script when block size is < 4k.
  11. Add code to test if removing an xattr from a full attribute fork
      succeeds.
  12. Add code to test if removing a file whose attribute fork is full
      succeeds.
  13. Add code to test if removing a entry from a full directory
      succeeds.
  14. Add code to test if removing a full directory succeeds.
  15. Writing to unwritten extents: Integrate buffered and direct I/O
      tests into a for loop.
  16. Writing to a shared extent test: Add test to check funshare
      operation.
  17. Use _scale_fsstress_args() to scale values for "-p" and "-n"
      arguments for fsstress.
