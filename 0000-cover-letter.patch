Subject: [PATCH V2 00/11] xfs: Tests to check for inode fork extent count overflow detection
To: fstests@vger.kernel.org
Cc: linux-xfs@vger.kernel.org,
    darrick.wong@oracle.com

The patchset at
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-xfs/20201117134416.207945-1-chandanrlinux@gmail.com/T/
added support to XFS to detect inode extent count overflow when
performing various filesystem operations. The patchset also added
new error injection tags for,
1. Reducing maximum extent count to 35.
2. Allocating only single block sized extents.

The corresponding code for xfsprogs can be obtained from
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-xfs/20201104114900.172147-1-chandanrlinux@gmail.com/.

The patches posted along with this cover letter add tests to verify if
the in-kernel inode extent count overflow detection mechanism works
correctly.

These patches can also be obtained from
https://github.com/chandanr/xfstests.git at branch
extent-overflow-tests.

Changelog:
V1 -> V2:
  1. Obtain extent count for inodes accessible through filesystem path
     names via "xfs_io -c 'stat' ..." command line. This gets rid of
     unmount/mount cycles from most of the tests.
  2. Use _fill_fs() to consume free space of a filesystem.
  3. Use _scratch_inject_error() helper to enable/disable error tags.
  4. Use sizeof(struct xfs_dqblk) to calculate number of quotas inside
     one filesystem block.
  5. Write once to every block of the quota inode instead of
     sequentially filling up each block.
  6. Use _get_file_block_size() for tests involving regular files.
  7. Modify tests to suit the new pseudo max extent count of 35.
  8. Replace xfs_io with $XFS_IO_PROG.
  9. Remove code that extended a realtime file since this takes the
     same path as direct I/O to a regular file.
  10. For xattr, do not execute test script when block size is < 4k.
  11. Add code to test if removing an xattr from a full attribute fork
      succeeds.
  12. Add code to test if removing a file whose attribute fork is full
      succeeds.
  13. Add code to test if removing a entry from a full directory
      succeeds.
  14. Add code to test if removing a full directory succeeds.
  15. Writing to unwritten extents: Integrate buffered and direct I/O
      tests into a for loop.
  16. Writing to a shared extent test: Add test to check funshare
      operation.
  17. Use _scale_fsstress_args() to scale values for "-p" and "-n"
      arguments for fsstress.
